I had to fiddle with duration after seeing somebody fork it on ny github feed. See a quick [screenrecord on vimeo](http://vimeo.com/80712056) 


1. get the [Duration.app](http://duration.cc) - [Code](https://github.com/YCAMInterlab/Duration)  
2. get the [procesing osc library](http://www.sojamo.de/libraries/oscP5/)  
3. get nuts
